# BookApp
This project was generated with Reactjs as the front-end framework and Ruby as the back-end framework. Maktaba is my fourth independent project, which incorporates my understanding of back-end development, specifically with Ruby.
The app is an interactive e-commerce application for booklovers. The vision is to create an application where book-nerds can update their personal libraries and create/list comments about their faverite books too.
it is still a work in progress and I am looking forward to developing it further.

# Development
Run npx create-react-app on the command line to set up your front-end framework. Majority of the back-end code is generated from my lab work. Consult Moringa/Flatiron for more information about their software engineering program. Read up more on  https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.
